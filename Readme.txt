JPar Compiler

This is a Java Source to Source compiler that automatically parallelizes Java code. The generated code runs on top of the Aeminium Runtime (http://github.com/AEminium/AeminiumRuntime/).

The compiler uses the Spoon Compiler Toolkit (http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/).

This is part of the Ã†minium Project (http://aeminium.dei.uc.pt)
